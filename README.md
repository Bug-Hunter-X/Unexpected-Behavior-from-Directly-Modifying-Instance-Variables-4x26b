# Ruby Bug: Instance Variable Modification

This repository demonstrates a potential issue in Ruby related to directly modifying instance variables using `instance_variable_set`.  Directly manipulating instance variables bypasses method encapsulation, which can be problematic.  The `bug.rb` file shows how this can lead to unexpected behavior and a lack of maintainability. The `bugSolution.rb` file illustrates a more robust approach.

## Problem

Modifying instance variables directly can lead to issues with code clarity, maintainability, and potential bugs.  If you later add methods that depend on instance variable integrity, those methods might break.   Debugging becomes harder because you lose visibility of how those variables are being updated.

## Solution

Always use methods to interact with instance variables.  This provides encapsulation, control, and clear visibility into the state changes of your objects. Methods allow you to add validation, logging, or any other logic needed to manage the variables effectively.
